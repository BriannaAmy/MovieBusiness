Team Gold: Brianna Beyer, Joshua Moe, Grant Samson, Tim Barney



Project Scope: What makes a movie successful?

Genre analysis: Whatâ€™s the most popular movie genre?

Box Office analysis: What are the movie trends based on box office numbers?

Movie Rating analysis: What the highest/lowest rated movies for both Metacritic and IMDb?

Runtime/Year analysis: What is the correlation between runtime and the release year?



Summary of Analysis:

The upset plot shows us that our top performing movie genres included Action and/or Adventure.

The scatter plot with box office vs. year shows a very weak correlation. 

If you compare Metacritic and IMDb ratings, you can see there is not overlap, so it is hard to see what movies are more successful from this information.

There is a moderate correlation between the year and runtime showing there is an upward trend of runtime over time.
